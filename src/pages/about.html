                                As a modern house builder looking to create beautiful modern homes, Metis Homes wanted their website to reflect the quality and detail of the properties they build. They felt their website was not portraying and showcase the stunning homes they build. With poor images sizes and no flexibility it was time to bring their website up to date.
