                                As a modern house builder looking to create beautiful modern homes, Metis Homes wanted their website to reflect the quality and detail of the properties they build. They felt their website was not portraying and showcase the stunning homes they build. With poor images sizes and no flexibility it was time to bring their website up to date.

                    <p>I designed the site to reflect the moto of Metis Homes “Modern homes. Tradition values.” Focusing on forward thinking and new media like virtual tours to fully display Metis’s homes. </p>
                    <p>I proposed we add a new accent colour to give the site a less monotone look which Metis like and now use across their brand.</p>

                    <p>Ease of navigation and contact played a large part  in the design of the site. As contact is the first way users can get in touch and start the process of buying their new home. So adding contact forms and permissions to download brochures was brought in, we also wanted the users to be able to read about other people’s experiences with Metis as they have a great repartition for customer care and providing a service.</p>
                    <p>The navigation is simple yet effective ensuring the user can navigate the site with ease and on any device.</p>
