                                As a modern house builder looking to create beautiful modern homes, Metis Homes wanted their website to reflect the quality and detail of the properties they build. They felt their website was not portraying and showcase the stunning homes they build. With poor images sizes and no flexibility it was time to bring their website up to date.

As contact is the first way users can get in touch and start the process of buying their new home. So adding contact forms and permissions to download brochures was brought in, we also wanted the users to be able to read about other people’s experiences with Metis as they have a great repartition for customer care and providing a service.</p>
