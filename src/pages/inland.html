                                This medium size house builder who a growing rapidly felt their website was lacking and users were struggling to find developments and dropping off the site. They also needed to give more information on each development and asked if we could make each development site feel like its own website whilst maintaining the general site. Points of contact was also a big part of the redesign so they could collect as much data as possible from the users. It’s important to remember that in the housing sector people are not loyal to any house builder.

                    <p>I designed the site to reflect the moto of Metis Homes “Modern homes. Tradition values.” Focusing on forward thinking and new media like virtual tours to fully display Metis’s homes. </p>
                    <p>I proposed we add a new accent colour to give the site a less monotone look which Metis like and now use across their brand.</p>

                    <p>Ease of navigation and contact played a large part  in the design of the site. As contact is the first way users can get in touch and start the process of buying their new home. So adding contact forms and permissions to download brochures was brought in, we also wanted the users to be able to read about other people’s experiences with Metis as they have a great repartition for customer care and providing a service.</p>
                    <p>The navigation is simple yet effective ensuring the user can navigate the site with ease and on any device.</p>
