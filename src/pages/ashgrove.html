                                As a modern house builder looking to create beautiful modern homes, Metis Homes wanted their website to reflect the quality and detail of the properties they build. They felt their website was not portraying and showcase the stunning homes they build. With poor images sizes and no flexibility it was time to bring their website up to date.

                        The site is design to reflect the moto of Metis Homes “Modern homes. Tradition values.” Focusing on forward thinking and new media like virtual tours to fully display Metis’s homes. 
                        I proposed we add a new accent colour to give the site a less monotone look which Metis like and now use across their brand.
